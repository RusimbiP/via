              Nortinium is a puzzle platformer designed using pixel art graphics, for those who love a challenge as well as a bit of gaming nostalgia.
              <br>
              <br>
              The game follows the adventures of Arthur Shadowstrike, as he navigates eight unique biomes within the realm of Nortinium, to retrieve the eight "Rings of Destiny" that were previously lost to history, and are believed to bring harmony and good fortune to the beholder.
              <br>
              <br>
              Join Arthur on his quest through different environments whilst using wit and strength to avoid perilous obstacles, take down enemies and collect the rings and other treasures along the way!
              <br>
